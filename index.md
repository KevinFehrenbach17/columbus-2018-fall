## Attendance Policy

Class is from 9:30AM-3:30PM Monday-Friday, with tutoring / study periods Mon-Fri 3:30PM-5:00PM.

You are required to attend a minimum of 90% of class time to be eligible for graduation. Attendance is measured *to the minute*: arriving late or leaving early will negatively impact your attendance. Please inform an instructor if extenuating circumstances arise.

## Grading Policy

In order to pass the course, you must receive a grade of 70% or higher averaged over all the assignments.

### Projects

Projects are graded by WCCI staff. Projects are typically worth 100 points. 90 points of each project will be determined by the tasks that are completed, with attempts resulting in partial credit for a given task. The final 10 points of each project are determined by overall code quality, considering code readability, well-named methods and variables, and comments where necessary.

#### Late and Incomplete Projects

Regarding late and incomplete projects, We Can Code IT’s policy is as follows:

In order to pass the course, you must receive a grade of 70% or higher averaged over all the assignments.

#### Unsatisfactory Progress Probationary Period

If a student is failing a portion of the program, the student will be placed on academic probation. In this time period, the student will be put on a remediation plan and is expected to complete and pass any portion of the class in which the student has failed. If the student cannot resolve his or her failing status satisfactorily, he or she may be dismissed from the program. The student may be eligible for a refund based upon our stated refund policies.

### Final Projects

Students must be passing the course prior to final projects to be eligible to participate in final projects.
